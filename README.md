# object_oriented_programming_course_uni

This repository contains my code for my Object Oriented Programming (OOP) course in uni. (in progress)

notes
- `class_k` = contains every class that is used for each meeting (labeled as _#M[x]_ in the file to separate classes used per meeting)
- `m[x]_task[y]` = _m[x]_ is the xth meeting of the course, and _task[y]_ is the yth task of the meeting
- prompts and some variable names are in Indonesian
- some class names are pretty random because of the instructions given by each assignment :v

## topics for each meeting

### week 1 (m01)

- introduction to oop (class creations, instantiating objects, properties, methods)
- task 1 = attendance list of lecturers (dosen) and students (mahasiswa)
- task 2 = simple stock report of an e-commerce website
- task 3 = creating a student ID card for a private course

### week 2 (m02)

- inheritance and polymorphism (super classes and subclasses)
- task 1 = making a parent class containing name, ID, and other general info; where the 2 child classes then inehrit those properties
- task 2 = making a parent class for a product (produk), then create classes for specific products, such as hand sanitizers, car wheels, bottles, etc that inherit properties and methods from the parent class

### week 3 (m03)

- abstract classes (abc library, abstract properties, and abstract methods)
- task 1 = creating 2 different child classes that inherit properties and methods from a parent class and an abstract class. The child classes both have a method with the same name but different outputs.
- task 2 = making an abstract class that has 3 abstract properties and 1 abstract method, and a parent class containing 3 properties (name, phone number, fee); Then, 3 child classes are created to inherit all those properties and methods. After that, adding a unique property to each child class (for example, in the `MuridSD` class, the gender (`jenisKelamin`) property is added to it; in the `MuridSMP` class, the age (`umur`) property is added to it)

### week 4 (m04)

- try and exception (ValueError, AttributeError, etc)
- both tasks require users to input data (such as names, phone numbers, genders, etc), then the program prevents inputs that don't meet the conditions (e.g. a person's name containing number and symbols)

### week 5 (m05)

- to be continue...
