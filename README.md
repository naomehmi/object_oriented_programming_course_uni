# object_oriented_programming_course_uni

This repository contains my code for my Object Oriented Programming (OOP) course in uni.

notes
- `class_k` = contains every class that is used for each meeting (labeled as _#M[x]_ in the file to separate classes used per meeting)
- `m[x]_task[y]` = _m[x]_ is the xth meeting of the course, and _task[y]_ is the yth task of the meeting
- prompts and some variable names are in Indonesian
- some class names are pretty random because of the instructions given by each assignment :v

# topics for each meeting

## week 1 (m01)

- introduction to oop (class creations, instantiating objects, properties, methods)
- task 1 = attendance list of lecturers (dosen) and students (mahasiswa)
- task 2 = simple stock report of an e-commerce website
- task 3 = creating a student ID card for a private course

## week 2 (m02)
